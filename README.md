#### Schematic Annotation and Validation
- **Tools**: Go to `Annotate` -> `Annotate Schematics` for component numbering.
- **Validation**: Validate the PCB project to check for errors.
#### Project Configuration
- **Project Options**: Navigate to `Project` -> `Project Options` -> `Class Generation` and uncheck `Generate Rooms`.
#### PCB Document Update
- **PCB Design**: Go to `Design` -> `Update PCB document` -> `Execute Change`.
#### PCB Dimensions
- **Define Board Shape**: Set board dimensions by going to `Design` -> `Redefine board shape` and set to 60mm x 25mm.
- **Component Placement**: Place components as per the schematic layout.
### Routing the Printed Circuit Board

For effective PCB routing:

#### Layer Management
- **Access Layers**: Navigate to `Design` -> `Layer Stack Manager` to configure the PCB layers according to your project requirements.

#### Setting Rules and Violations
- **Open Panels**: Navigate to `Panels` -> `PCB Rules and Violations` to set up and monitor design constraints.
  - **Clearance**: Set `minimum clearance` to 1.3mm.
  - **Width Constraint**: Define the trace width with `Min width` at 0.3mm and `Max width` at 1mm.
  - **Routing Via Style**: Adjust via settings with `Min/Max/Preferred Diameter` at 0.6mm and `Min/Max/Preferred Via Hole Size` at 0.3mm.
  - **Silk to Solder Mask Clearance**: Set `Silk to Solder Mask Clearance` at 0.1mm.
  - **Unrouted Net Constraints**: Ensure all connections are complete by checking `unrouted net constraints`.

#### Interactive Routing
- **Manual Routing**: Utilize the `interactive routing` tool available under the `Routing` menu to manually draw each connection. Ensure each trace complies with the established design rules to achieve optimal placement for signal integrity and manufacturability.
- **Design Rule Check**: 
  - Navigate to `Tools` -> `Design Rule Check` to verify the board against the set design rules.
  - Ensure there are no errors reported in the Design Rule Verification Report.
- **Ground Plane Management**:
  - For creating isolated areas in the ground plane, go to `Place` -> `Polygon Pour Cutout`.
  - Set the properties to `Net: GND` and `Layer: Bottom Layer` to define the cutout parameters.
